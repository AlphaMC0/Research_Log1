 - Distance :
   - Nio(ni-o) 1nio or 1n = 5miles
   - Dio(di-o) 1dio or 1d = 1/2n  2d = 1n
   - Rio(ri-o) 1rio or 1r = 1/2d  2r = 1d , 4r = 1n
 - Weight :
   - Ker(k-er) 1ker or 1k = 10kilograms
   - Ber(b-er) 1ber or 1b = 1/2 k   2b = 1k
   - Ter(T-er) 1ter or 1t = 1/2 b   2t = 1b , 4t = 1k
 - Time :
   - Yem(ye-m) 1yem or 1y = 2h
   - Lem(le-m) 1lem or 1l = 1h   2l = 1y
   - Qem(qe-m) 1qem or 1q = 30min  2q = 1l , 4q = 1y
 - Temperature :
   - Pal(pa-l) 1pal or 1p = 10 degrees celsius 1bp = 1,000,000,000p = 10,000,000,000 degrees celsius
+ **Materials/Items**
 - Mithril :
     1k of mithril ore has a power output of 1GW. Mithril can also be used in a bomb. Mithril will blow up if the ore's power absorbtion limit is exceeded. The maximum power absorbtion limit of mithril is 1GW. It is recomended to only 
   use 80% of the mithril's power so it only has a 25% chance of blowing up. If you use 100% of the mithril's power it has a 50% chance of blowing up. If mithril blows-up it has a blast radius of 10n. It takes mithril 1y to fully regain 
   its power from any percentage of power it has left. Mithril can only be found in two small deposits the base is located on one deposit. Mithril deposits can be found anywhere below 1n.(More research must be done)
 - Orthrim :
       Orthrim can neglect 99% of all physcal attacks from any weapon the only weapon that can distroy orthrim is an energy weapon based on mithril. Orthrim is commonly used for protection and as holding cells. Orthrim will melt at 50bp.
   Orthrim can be found near the core of mars.
 - Anti :
       Anti can neglect all gravity and it can also invoke gravity on anything it can be disabled by distroying the core located in the center of the gem.The ore has the texture of mud and it is clear emitating a dim red glow. Anti will 
   melt at  20p. Anti can  be found 10n below the polar ice-caps of mars.(More research must be done)
 - Nth :
       Nth can provide the user with overwhelming strength. Nth can't be frozen or melted it can only be distroyed by a mithril based energy weapon. Nth will also deplete the players energy. You can counter this by constantly pumping 
   the body with energy to replenish the supply that has been used up by the nth gem. Nth can be found 100n below the polar ice-caps of mars.(More research must be done)
 - Aluminium Oxide C11 :
       This ore is used to create the strongest type of glass that can only be distroyed by a mithril based energy weapon. This ore has a clear color and very hard it will melt at 1bp. This ore can be found 1bn below the surface of mars.
 - Copper B4 :
       Copper B4 is used to conduct heat and electricity. Copper B4 will melt at 600p. CopperB4 can found by strip mining the surface of mars.
 - Healorim :
       Healorim can heal any disease or injury. Healorim can't be distroyed, but it can degrade if not used for a long time. This gem can be found in the core of mars.(More research must be done)
 - Atractium :
       Atractium can atract any metal. It can be melted at 100p. Atractium can be found 1000n below the surface of mars.
 - Rethrim :
       Rethrim can purify anything . I is found on the outside of mithril deposits. I can be used to control mithril. It will not freeze but will melt at 100000p.(More research must be done)
